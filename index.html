      <img src="assets/images/Roxy.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Roxana">

      <p>I graduated from a program called Year Up where I did 6 months of technical training in IT. Once I completed my training, I earned the opportunity to Intern at facebook on the GMS App Op’s team as Marketing Intern. I worked with the internal fb teams, and was responsible for launching email campaigns for them. Currently I’m at Vaco onsite at Google as content analyst on the Google Search Ads Team. I’m there for a project that consist of analyzing advertisements and making proper updates to the ads to make sure only quality ads get produced. This results in our users having a positive experience with our ads.</p>

      <p>I have a passion for learning new platforms and tools, which is what drove me to attend the Berkeley Extension Program, where I am learning Full Stack Programming. At the end of the program I will have acquired the skills and knowledge to become a web developer.

      <p>During my free time I enjoy trying out new restaurants, reading self help books and poetry, my latest obsession is Audible. I also enjoy going on short hikes and walks with my 5 year old daughter.</p>
